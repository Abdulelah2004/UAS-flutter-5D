# Dice Game: Abdulelah Ahmed's Final Project for Mobile Programming 5D

Welcome to the **Dice Game**, the ultimate challenge of luck and fun! ðŸŽ²âœ¨

This project is my final submission for **Mobile Programming 5D**. Itâ€™s a simple yet exciting dice-rolling game built using **Flutter**, where two players can roll dice, compete for points, and experience the thrill of winning! The goal is to reach 50 points first, and when a player wins, a burst of confetti fills the screen to celebrate their victory. ðŸŽ‰

## How to Play:

1. Enter the names of **Player 1** and **Player 2** on the input screen.
2. Roll the dice by tapping on the dice images.
3. Keep track of your score! The first player to reach 50 points wins.
4. Celebrate your victory with a burst of confetti and a message announcing the winner!

## How to Run:

If you're excited to play, hereâ€™s how you can run this app on your local machine:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```
   cd dicee_app
   ```

3. **Ensure you have Flutter installed** (check the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) if needed).

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

5. **Run the app**:
   ```
   flutter run
   ```

Now, youâ€™re all set to roll the dice and have fun! Enjoy the game and donâ€™t forget to celebrate your victory with some confetti! ðŸŽ‰

### Notes:

- This app is designed to be simple, fun, and responsive.
- The confetti feature adds a fun, celebratory touch to the game, triggered when a player wins.
- Playersâ€™ scores are updated as they roll the dice, and the game ends when a player reaches or exceeds 50 points.

Hope you enjoy the game as much as I did building it! ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥
